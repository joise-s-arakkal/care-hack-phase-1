# Sound Explorer

Sound Explorer is a simple, accessible web-based game where players navigate a grid using sound clues to find a hidden treasure. The game is designed to be playable by everyone, including those with visual impairments, as it relies on audio feedback to guide the player.

## How to Play

1.  **Objective:** The goal is to find the hidden treasure on the 5x5 grid.
2.  **Controls:** Use the **arrow keys** (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) to move your character (the smiley face) around the grid.
3.  **Sound Clues:** With each move, a beep will sound. The pitch of the beep indicates your proximity to the treasure:
    *   A **higher-pitched beep** means you are getting closer to the treasure.
    *   A **lower-pitched beep** means you are moving farther away.
4.  **Winning:** When you move to the same cell as the treasure, a special sound will play, and a success message will be displayed.

## Features

*   **Zero-dependency:** The game runs entirely in the browser with no external libraries needed.
*   **Accessible by Design:** The core gameplay mechanic is based on audio feedback, making it accessible to players with visual impairments.
